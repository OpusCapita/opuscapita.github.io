                        <h2>User interface guidelines</h2>
                        <p>
                            These guidelines are to be used as a UI reference by OpusCapita developers, interaction designers, visual designers and other relevant roles when creating web-based user interfaces. It is a tool for giving a consistent user experience for our products. It helps to ensure that the interactive elements are consistent: they look and behave the same way throughout the service and between the services.<br><br>

							OpusCapita uses an extended version of Twitter Bootstrap for web-based HTML5 user interfaces. OCUI is responsive, supporting large to small screens, even if not all implemented views take advantage of Bootstrap's responsive mechanics. <br><br>

							The purpose is to document what is already there, the parts of OpusCapita that are proven by practice to work. What is the web-based product style and what makes the UI look and feel like OpusCapita? <br><br>

							This guideline does not catalogue all the UI components in use in OpusCapita web-based products, but is intended a reference of reusable elements.  We aim to make updates to this guideline as new common practices and design needs appear. <br><br>

                            Please note that this guideline is to be followed with new products and for existing or
                            rebranded products common sense and recommendations from the Brand -page should be used in whenever following of the guideline makes sense.
                        </p>

                        <h2>UX Design</h2>
                        <h3>User experience (UX)</h3>
                        <p>UX includes all the experiences that users have every time they come across company’s products and also e.g. Company’s web pages. How these products work and how they work together affects the total UX. That is why it is important to have UI guidelines and best practices defined</p>

                        <h3>Great usability</h3>
                        <p>Usability is a quality measure for design. Usability may feel like a vague term, but at its heart, designers are simply asking “can someone easily use this?” Nielsen and Schneiderman explain usability as being made up of five principles:
						<ul>
							<li>Learnability: how easily can a new user learn to navigate the interface?</li>
							<li>Efficiency: how quickly can users perform tasks?</li>
							<li>Memorability: if a user hasn’t visited the system in a while, how well will they remember the interface?</li>
							<li>Errors: how many errors do users make, and how quickly can they recover from errors?</li>
							<li>Satisfaction: do users enjoy using the interface, and are they pleased with the results?</li>
						</ul>
                       </p>
